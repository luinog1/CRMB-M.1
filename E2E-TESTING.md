# End-to-End Testing Plan

## 1. Home Screen
- **Objective:** Verify that the home screen correctly loads and displays the default catalogs from the configured Stremio addons.
- **Steps:**
  1. Start the backend and frontend servers.
  2. Open the application in a browser.
  3. Observe the home screen for content.
- **Expected Result:** The home screen should display catalogs of movies, series, or other content from the configured Stremio addons.

## 2. Search Functionality
- **Objective:** Test the search functionality to ensure it returns accurate results from the addons for various queries.
- **Steps:**
  1. Navigate to the search page.
  2. Perform a search with a known movie/series title (e.g., "The Matrix").
  3. Perform a search with a more generic query (e.g., "action").
- **Expected Result:** Search results should be relevant to the query and sourced from the Stremio addons.

## 3. No Duplicate Results
- **Objective:** Confirm that there are no duplicate results, either on the home screen or in the search results.
- **Steps:**
  1. Inspect the home screen for any identical items.
  2. Perform a search and inspect the results for duplicates.
- **Expected Result:** All items displayed should be unique.

## 4. Metadata and Streams
- **Objective:** Check the detail pages to ensure that metadata and stream information are being fetched and displayed correctly.
- **Steps:**
  1. Click on an item from the home screen or search results.
  2. Verify that the detail page displays metadata like title, year, description, and poster.
  3. Check for a list of available streams.
- **Expected Result:** The detail page should show complete metadata and a list of available streams for the selected item.

## 5. Error Handling
- **Objective:** Test how the application responds to errors, such as when an addon is unavailable or returns an error.
- **Steps:**
  1. Stop one of the backend addon services (if possible, or misconfigure an addon URL).
  2. Refresh the home screen.
  3. Perform a search.
- **Expected Result:** The application should handle the error gracefully, for example, by showing a message to the user and not crashing. Content from other available addons should still be displayed.
