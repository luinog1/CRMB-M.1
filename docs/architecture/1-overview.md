# 1. Overview

The CRUMBLE architecture is designed for security, scalability, and a modern user experience. It employs a **Single Page Application (SPA)** model for the frontend and a **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)** for the backend. This separation of concerns is critical: the client is responsible *only* for presentation, while the BFF handles all business logic, data fetching, and secure management of API keys.
