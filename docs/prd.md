# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

- **Project:** CRUMBLE - Minimalist Media Aggregator
- **Status:** Prototype - Scoped for V0.1
- **Author:** Project Lead
- **Date:** October 26, 2023

---

## 1. Introduction & Problem Statement

Tech-savvy media consumers on macOS lack a single, elegant, browser-based application to discover, manage, and play content from diverse sources. They are forced to use multiple, often clunky, applications for tracking (Trakt), discovery (TMDB), and streaming (Stremio), resulting in a fragmented and inefficient user experience.

CRUMBLE is a minimalist, performant, browser-based media aggregator that provides a single, beautiful interface to unify these services, creating a seamless "discovery-to-playback" journey.

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics

- **Product Goal:** To validate the core user hypothesis: that a unified, performant, and aesthetically-pleasing interface for Stremio, Trakt, and TMDB is a desirable product for our target user.
- **Technical Goal:** To prove the technical feasibility of integrating these disparate services into a stable, browser-based React application.
- **Success Metrics (KPIs):**
    - **Performance:** Lighthouse score >90 across Performance, Accessibility, and Best Practices categories.
    - **Reliability:** >99.5% success rate for all backend API proxy calls.
    - **Functionality:** >95% success rate for initiating a stream playback from a valid source.

## 3. Target Audience & User Persona

The primary user is the **"Tech-Savvy macOS Aesthete."** This individual is deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem, values superior design and performance, and is frustrated by tools that are functional but lack elegance. They desire a powerful, consolidated tool that feels native to their high-end computing environment.

## 4. User Stories

| ID | As a... | I want to... | So that I can... |

## 5. Functional Requirements (Features)

**Priority:** P0 = Must-have for Prototype, P1 = Future Release

| ID | Feature | Description | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :---| :---: |
| **F-01**| **Content Discovery (Home Page)**| Display carousels of "Trending" and "New Releases" content fetched from TMDB. Includes a hero banner with a search input. | P0 |
| **F-02**| **Search Functionality** | Allow users to search for movies and TV shows via the TMDB API. Results should display in a clear grid format. |P0 |
| **F-03**| **Content Detail View** | A dedicated page showing detailed metadata for a selected item, including poster, summary, and other relevant info. | P0 |
| **F-04**| **Stream Sourcing** | When on a detail page, the application must query the Stremio addon ecosystem to find available streaming links for the content. | P0 |
| **F-05**| **Integrated Video Player** | An in-app HTML5 video player (Plyr) that can play the selected stream URL. | P0 |
| **F-06**| **Trakt.tv Authentication**| A secure OAuth2 flow that allows users to link their Trakt.tv account. For the prototype, the token is stored in `localStorage`.| P0 |
| **F-07**| **Library View** | A dedicated page that displays the user's Trakt watchlist, fetched via the Trakt API. | P0 |
| **F-08**| **Two-Way Watchlist Sync** | A button on the content detail page to add the current item to the user's Trakt watchlist. | P0 |

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

| Category | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Performance** | The application must feel fast and responsive. Initial page load must be optimized, and UI interactions (hover, navigation) should be fluid. |
| **Usability** | The interface must be clean, minimalist, and intuitive, adhering to design principles common in the macOS ecosystem. |
| **Security** | All third-party API keys (TMDB, Trakt) must be stored securely on the backend and never exposed to the client-side browser. |
| **Compatibility**| The application must be fully functional and visually consistent on the latest versions of Google Chrome and Safari on macOS. |

## 7. Out of Scope (For This Prototype)

- Full user account system (email/password login).
- Dockerization or advanced deployment configurations.
- PWA features (offline mode, push notifications).
- Advanced player features (subtitle selection, audio tracks).
