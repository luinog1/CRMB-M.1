# 1. Introduction & Problem Statement

Tech-savvy media consumers on macOS lack a single, elegant, browser-based application to discover, manage, and play content from diverse sources. They are forced to use multiple, often clunky, applications for tracking (Trakt), discovery (TMDB), and streaming (Stremio), resulting in a fragmented and inefficient user experience.

CRUMBLE is a minimalist, performant, browser-based media aggregator that provides a single, beautiful interface to unify these services, creating a seamless "discovery-to-playback" journey.
