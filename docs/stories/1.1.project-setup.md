# Story 1.1: Project Setup

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Tech-Savvy macOS Aesthete,
**I want** a well-structured foundation for the CRUMBLE application,
**so that** I can have a performant and aesthetically-pleasing interface for managing my media content.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Project is initialized with React for frontend (Vite) and Node.js/Express for backend (BFF)
2. Basic project structure is set up according to the architecture document
3. Development environment is configured with necessary dependencies
4. Basic routing is implemented for frontend navigation
5. BFF server is set up with basic API endpoints structure
6. Configuration is in place for environment variables and API keys
7. Project successfully builds and runs locally

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Frontend Setup (AC: 1, 2, 4, 7)
  - [ ] Initialize React project using Vite
  - [ ] Set up project structure (components, pages, services, utils)
  - [ ] Configure routing using React Router
  - [ ] Create placeholder components for main pages (Home, Search, Detail, Library)
  - [ ] Set up basic styling with CSS framework (preferably Tailwind CSS)
  - [ ] Configure proxy for API requests to BFF

- [ ] Backend Setup (AC: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7)
  - [ ] Initialize Node.js/Express project
  - [ ] Set up project structure (routes, controllers, services, utils)
  - [ ] Configure environment variables for API keys
  - [ ] Implement basic API endpoints structure for TMDB, Trakt, and Stremio
  - [ ] Set up CORS and other necessary middleware
  - [ ] Create health check endpoint

- [ ] Integration and Testing (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Ensure frontend can communicate with BFF
  - [ ] Implement basic error handling
  - [ ] Set up testing framework for both frontend and backend
  - [ ] Create basic tests for critical paths

## Dev Notes

This story focuses on setting up the initial project structure according to the architecture document. The CRUMBLE application follows a Single Page Application (SPA) model for the frontend and a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) pattern for the backend.

### Architecture Overview
The application consists of two main components:
1. **Frontend**: React SPA running on localhost:5173
2. **Backend**: Node.js/Express BFF server running on localhost:3001

The BFF server will handle all communication with external APIs (TMDB, Trakt.tv, Stremio Addon Ecosystem) and manage API keys securely.

### Frontend Structure
- Use React with Vite for fast development experience
- Implement routing with React Router
- Consider using Tailwind CSS for styling to achieve a clean, minimalist interface
- Organize code into logical folders (components, pages, services, utils)

### Backend Structure
- Use Node.js with Express for the BFF server
- Implement API routes for each external service (/api/tmdb/*, /api/trakt/*, /api/stremio/*)
- Use environment variables for storing API keys
- Implement proper error handling and logging

### Testing
Implement basic testing for both frontend and backend to ensure the foundation is solid before building features.

### Testing Standards
- Frontend: Use Vitest (comes with Vite) or Jest for unit testing
- Backend: Use Jest or Mocha for API testing
- Consider implementing basic integration tests to verify frontend-backend communication
