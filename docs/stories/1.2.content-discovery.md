## Dev Notes

This story implements Feature F-01 from the PRD: Content Discovery (Home Page). It focuses on creating the main landing page of the application that will display trending and new release content from TMDB.

### Frontend Implementation
- Create a Home page component with a hero banner and search input
- Implement horizontal carousels for "Trending" and "New Releases" content
- Each carousel item should display a movie/show poster and title
- Clicking on a carousel item should navigate to the content detail view
- Implement loading states and error handling

### Backend Implementation
- Create a TMDB API service in the BFF to handle requests to the TMDB API
- Implement endpoints for fetching trending content and new releases
- The BFF should handle the TMDB API key securely
- Consider implementing a caching mechanism to improve performance and reduce API calls

### API Endpoints
- GET `/api/tmdb/trending` - Fetch trending movies and TV shows
- GET `/api/tmdb/new-releases` - Fetch newly released movies and TV shows

### UI/UX Considerations
- The UI should be clean, minimalist, and follow macOS aesthetic principles
- Use smooth animations for carousel navigation
- Implement proper loading states and error handling
- Ensure the design is responsive and works well on different screen sizes

### Testing Standards
- Frontend: Test carousel navigation, loading states, and error handling
- Backend: Test API endpoints for proper data fetching and error handling
- Implement unit tests for components and API services
