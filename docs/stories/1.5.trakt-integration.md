# Story 1.5: Trakt.tv Integration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Tech-Savvy macOS Aesthete,
**I want to** connect my Trakt.tv account securely and view my watchlist,
**so that** I can sync my existing library and watch history with the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can authenticate with Trakt.tv using a secure OAuth2 flow
2. Authentication token is stored securely in localStorage
3. User can view their Trakt watchlist in a dedicated Library page
4. Watchlist displays movie/show posters and titles in a grid format
5. User can add/remove content to/from their watchlist from the detail page
6. Changes to the watchlist sync bidirectionally with Trakt.tv
7. UI is clean, minimalist, and follows macOS aesthetic principles
8. Authentication and watchlist operations have appropriate loading and error states

  - [ ] Implement unit tests for components and API services

## Dev Notes

This story implements Features F-06, F-07, and F-08 from the PRD: Trakt.tv Authentication, Library View, and Two-Way Watchlist Sync. It focuses on integrating with Trakt.tv to allow users to authenticate, view their watchlist, and add/remove content.

### Authentication Implementation
- Implement a secure OAuth2 flow for Trakt.tv authentication
- Store the authentication token securely in localStorage
- Add authentication state management to track user login status
- Implement token refresh mechanism to maintain session

### Library Page Implementation
- Create a dedicated Library page that displays the user's Trakt watchlist
- Implement a grid layout for watchlist items, showing posters and titles
- Add loading states and error handling for watchlist fetching

### Watchlist Management
- Add "Add to Watchlist" button on the content detail page
- Implement functionality to add/remove content from the watchlist
- Create visual feedback for watchlist operations
- Ensure changes sync bidirectionally with Trakt.tv

### Backend Implementation
- Create endpoints in the BFF for Trakt.tv authentication
- Implement watchlist fetching and management endpoints
- Add proper error handling and response formatting

### API Endpoints
- GET `/api/trakt/auth` - Initiate Trakt.tv OAuth2 flow
- GET `/api/trakt/callback` - Handle OAuth2 callback
- GET `/api/trakt/watchlist` - Fetch user's watchlist
- POST `/api/trakt/watchlist/add` - Add content to watchlist
- DELETE `/api/trakt/watchlist/remove` - Remove content from watchlist

### UI/UX Considerations
- The authentication flow should be seamless and user-friendly
- The Library page should have a clean, minimalist design
- Watchlist operations should provide clear visual feedback
- Loading states and error handling should ensure a smooth user experience

### Testing Standards
- Frontend: Test authentication flow, watchlist display, and add/remove functionality
- Backend: Test API endpoints for proper data fetching and error handling
- Implement unit tests for components and API services
