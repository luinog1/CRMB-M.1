# Story 1.4: Content Detail View

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Tech-Savvy macOS Aesthete,
**I want to** view details about a movie or TV show, including its poster and summary,
**so that** I can get more information to decide if I want to watch it.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Detail page displays comprehensive metadata for the selected content
2. Content metadata includes poster, title, year, summary, and other relevant info
3. Page shows available streaming sources fetched from Stremio addon ecosystem
4. User can play a selected stream directly within the application
5. User can add the content to their Trakt watchlist (if authenticated)
6. UI is clean, minimalist, and follows macOS aesthetic principles
7. Content and streaming sources load with appropriate loading states
8. Error states are handled gracefully

## Dev Notes

This story implements Features F-03, F-04, and F-05 from the PRD: Content Detail View, Stream Sourcing, and Integrated Video Player. It focuses on creating a comprehensive detail page for movies and TV shows, finding available streaming sources, and enabling playback.

### Frontend Implementation
- Create a detail page that displays comprehensive metadata for the selected content
- Implement sections for poster, title, year, summary, and other relevant information
- Add a section for displaying available streaming sources
- Integrate an HTML5 video player (Plyr) for stream playback
- Implement "Add to Watchlist" functionality for authenticated users
- Add loading states and error handling for content and streaming sources

### Backend Implementation
- Create endpoints in the BFF for fetching content details from TMDB
- Implement a service for querying the Stremio addon ecosystem to find streaming sources
- Create an endpoint for adding content to the user's Trakt watchlist
- Implement proper error handling and response formatting

### API Endpoints
- GET `/api/tmdb/content/{id}` - Fetch detailed metadata for a specific movie or TV show
- GET `/api/stremio/streams/{type}/{id}` - Find available streaming sources for content
- POST `/api/trakt/watchlist/add` - Add content to the user's Trakt watchlist

### UI/UX Considerations
- The detail page should be visually appealing with a clean, minimalist design
- Content metadata should be clearly organized and easy to read
- Streaming sources should be presented in a user-friendly way
- The video player should be intuitive and easy to use
- Loading states and error handling should provide a smooth user experience

### Testing Standards
- Frontend: Test content display, streaming source selection, video playback, and watchlist functionality
- Backend: Test API endpoints for proper data fetching and error handling
- Implement unit tests for components and API services
