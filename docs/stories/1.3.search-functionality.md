# Story 1.3: Search Functionality

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Tech-Savvy macOS Aesthete,
**I want to** search for a specific movie or TV show by name,
**so that** I can quickly find the exact content I want to watch.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Search input is accessible from the home page hero banner
2. User can enter search terms and submit via enter key or search button
3. Search results display in a clear grid format
4. Each search result shows the movie/show poster, title, and year
5. Search results load with appropriate loading states
6. Empty search results and error states are handled gracefully
7. Clicking on a search result navigates to the content detail view
8. UI is clean, minimalist, and follows macOS aesthetic principles

## Dev Notes

This story implements Feature F-02 from the PRD: Search Functionality. It focuses on allowing users to search for movies and TV shows via the TMDB API.

### Frontend Implementation
- The search input should be prominently displayed in the hero banner on the home page
- Implement a search results page that displays results in a grid format
- Each search result should display the movie/show poster, title, and year
- Clicking on a search result should navigate to the content detail view
- Implement loading states, empty states, and error handling

### Backend Implementation
- Create a search endpoint in the BFF that queries the TMDB API
- The endpoint should accept a query parameter and return formatted search results
- Implement proper error handling for API requests
- Consider adding basic caching for recent searches to improve performance

### API Endpoints
- GET `/api/tmdb/search?query={searchTerm}` - Search for movies and TV shows

### UI/UX Considerations
- The search input should be easily accessible and visually prominent
- Search results should load quickly with appropriate loading states
- Empty search results and error states should be handled gracefully
- The UI should be clean, minimalist, and follow macOS aesthetic principles

### Testing Standards
- Frontend: Test search input, results display, loading states, and error handling
- Backend: Test search endpoint for proper data fetching and error handling
- Implement unit tests for search components and API service
