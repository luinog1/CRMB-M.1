# Epic 1: Core Functionality - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Implement the core functionality of the CRUMBLE application to provide a minimalist media aggregator that unifies Stremio, Trakt, and TMDB services, creating a seamless "discovery-to-playback" journey for tech-savvy macOS users.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

- Current relevant functionality: None (new project)
- Technology stack: React SPA for frontend, Node.js/Express BFF for backend
- Integration points: TMDB API, Trakt.tv API, Stremio Addon Ecosystem

### Enhancement Details

- What's being added: A complete minimalist media aggregator application with content discovery, search, detail view, stream sourcing, integrated video player, Trakt.tv authentication, library view, and two-way watchlist sync.
- How it integrates: The application follows a Single Page Application (SPA) model for the frontend and a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) pattern for the backend. The BFF server handles all communication with external APIs and manages API keys securely.
- Success criteria: 
  - Lighthouse score >90 across Performance, Accessibility, and Best Practices categories
  - >99.5% success rate for all backend API proxy calls
  - >95% success rate for initiating a stream playback from a valid source

## Stories

1. **Story 1.1: Project Setup** - Set up the initial project structure with React for frontend and Node.js/Express for backend according to the architecture document.
2. **Story 1.2: Content Discovery (Home Page)** - Implement the home page with trending and new releases content carousels fetched from TMDB.
3. **Story 1.3: Search Functionality** - Create a search feature that allows users to find specific movies or TV shows by name.
4. **Story 1.4: Content Detail View** - Develop a detailed view for selected content with metadata and streaming sources.
5. **Story 1.5: Trakt Integration** - Implement Trakt.tv authentication and watchlist synchronization.

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged (N/A - new project)
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (N/A - new project)
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (N/A - new project, but will follow macOS aesthetic principles)
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (N/A - new project, but performance is a key requirement)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Integration with multiple external APIs (TMDB, Trakt.tv, Stremio) may lead to reliability issues
- **Mitigation:** Implement proper error handling, caching strategies, and fallback mechanisms
- **Rollback Plan:** Each feature will be developed and deployed incrementally, allowing for isolated rollback if needed
